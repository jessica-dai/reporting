The data saved in the `vaers` and `hmda` folders can be used directly. At the time of paper writing, data could be downloaded from government websites directly; due to active uncertainty in federal directives, we have uploaded our processed data directly, and have included processing code for reference. 

Data (as of late 2024) could be downloaded at the following urls: 
* VAERS database [here](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html) and VaxView [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/adultvaxview/index.html) (with an API available [here](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cdc.gov/kevv-m5vs)).
